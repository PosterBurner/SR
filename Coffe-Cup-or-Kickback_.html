It was the talk of the internet the past few days. You could not miss the coverage unless you were in a cave. I took notice of this as I am the owner of a Film and Television post production company in Hollywood that specializes in TV and Film QC. I have been in the industry for 28 years and have worked for some of the biggest TV networks, and post facilities in both New York City, and Los Angeles. As the owner of QC Central I knew there was no way this could have escaped our attention, and I wondered how it got by the QC department at HBO, not to mention the cameraman, producer, director, on set assistants, prop master, editor, colorist and others who should have caught this discrepancy. I wrote an article about this big coffee cup fail on the QC Central blog, in which I discuss my theory as to what really happened, and how so many people could have missed such an obvious thing as a modern day coffee cup would be in a show where they would be drinking from Pewter Goblets. At QC Central we make sure that these types of mistakes never happen in the first place, we are the last line of defense against shows going to air with problems that will be noticed live in front of millions by someone who is going to be looking for responsible party and call them on the carpet big time.
